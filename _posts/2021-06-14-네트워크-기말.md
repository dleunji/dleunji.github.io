- Compare and contrast link-state and distance-vector routing algorithms.

  - **Link State**
    - 네트워크 전체를 인식
    - 라우터와 라우터를 연결하는 링크 상태에 따라 최적의 경로 설정
    - 변화 발생 시 정보 전송(Synchronous) - 네트워크 정보를 라우터 간에 모두 동기화한 뒤 라우팅 테이블 동시 생성
    - 프로토콜 : **OSPF**
      - 계층적 구조
      - 라우터의 모든 경로 정보가 아닌 각 라우터의 고유 접속 정보만 전달
  - **Distance Vector**
    - 이웃한 라우터의 시각에서 네트워크 인식
    - 네트워크 변화 발생 시 해당 정보를 인접한 라우터에 정기적으로 전달하고, 인접 라우터에서는 라우팅 테이블에 정보 갱신
    - 일정 주기로 정보 전송(Asynchronous)
    - 프로토콜: RIP(Routing Information Protocol), IGRP(Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)

- Discuss how a **hierarchical** organization of the Internet has made it possible to scale to millions of users.

  - Boundary router : connect to other AS's router
  - backbone router : run OSPF routing limited to backbone
  - area border router : summarize distances to nets in own area, advertise to other area border routers
  - internal router

- Is it necessary that every autonomous system use the same intra-AS routing algorithm?

  Why or why not?

  - No
  - Each AS routing has administrative autonomy for routing within as AS

- Why are different inter-AS and intra-AS protocols used in the Internet?
  - Policy
    - Inter AS에서는 traffic originating in each AS cannot pass through another specific AS
    - BGP(Border Gateway Protocol) carries the path attributes and provides for the controlled distribution of routing information leading to the policy-based routing decisions
    - In the Intra-As routing protocol, the AS is under the same administrative control. So the policy issues play a less important role in choosing routes.
  - Scalabiliy
  - Performance
    - The inter-As is the policy-oriented protocol. The policy of the inter-AS domainates the quality and the performance associated with the routes among the AS's
    - The intra-AS focuses on the performance of the routing ona router because of a single AS.
- Why are policy considerations as important for intra-AS protocols, such as OSPF and RIP, as they are for an inter-AS routing protocol like BGP?
  - The OSPF routing algorithm which is an intra-AS routing algorithm. It is used to the weights of the links in routing paths that minimize the overall cost. Link weights is used to flow of routing in a network. The goal the maximum link utilization or minimize link utilization is depends on the set of link weight by the router.
- How big is the MAC address space? The IPv4 address space? The IPv6 address?
  - 48bits 16진수로 4bit씩 해서 12개로 쪼갠다.
- Describe polling and token-passing protocols using the analogy of cocktail party interactions.
  - 
- Why would the token-ring protocol be inefficient if a LAN had a very large perimeter?
