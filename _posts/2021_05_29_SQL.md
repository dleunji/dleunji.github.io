내일 예정된 SK C&C 코테에 SQL문제가 있을 줄이야..ㅠ

그래서 급하게 Leetcode로 푼 SQL을 정리하고자 한다.

**176.**

Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the `Employee` table.

```
+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
```

For example, given the above Employee table, the query should return `200` as the second highest salary. If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return `null`.

```
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+
```

```sql
SELECT Salary AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM Employee
ORDER BY Salary DESC LIMIT 1,1 
```

LIMIT (시작점, 개수)

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
    Salary AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM
    Employee
ORDER BY Salary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1
```

LIMIT 숫자 : 출력할 행의 수

OFFSET 숫자 : 몇번째 row부터 출력할 지. (1번째 row면 0)

**175.**

Table: `Person`

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| PersonId    | int     |
| FirstName   | varchar |
| LastName    | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
PersonId is the primary key column for this table.
```

Table: `Address`

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| AddressId   | int     |
| PersonId    | int     |
| City        | varchar |
| State       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
AddressId is the primary key column for this table.
```

 

Write a SQL query for a report that provides the following information for each person in the Person table, regardless if there is an address for each of those people:

```
FirstName, LastName, City, State
```

```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName, City, State
FROM Person LEFT JOIN Address
ON Person.PersonId = Address.PersonId;
```



177.

Write a SQL query to get the *n*th highest salary from the `Employee` table.

```
+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
```

For example, given the above Employee table, the *n*th highest salary where *n* = 2 is `200`. If there is no *n*th highest salary, then the query should return `null`.

```
+------------------------+
| getNthHighestSalary(2) |
+------------------------+
| 200                    |
+------------------------+
```

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
DECLARE M INT;
SET M=N-1;
  RETURN (
      # Write your MySQL query statement below.
      SELECT Salary
      FROM Employee
      ORDER BY Salary DESC LIMIT M, 1
  );
END
```

핵심은

`DECLARE M INT;
SET M=N-1;`

**178.**

Write a SQL query to rank scores. If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking. Note that after a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. In other words, there should be no "holes" between ranks.

```
+----+-------+
| Id | Score |
+----+-------+
| 1  | 3.50  |
| 2  | 3.65  |
| 3  | 4.00  |
| 4  | 3.85  |
| 5  | 4.00  |
| 6  | 3.65  |
+----+-------+
```

For example, given the above `Scores` table, your query should generate the following report (order by highest score):

```
+-------+---------+
| score | Rank    |
+-------+---------+
| 4.00  | 1       |
| 4.00  | 1       |
| 3.85  | 2       |
| 3.65  | 3       |
| 3.65  | 3       |
| 3.50  | 4       |
+-------+---------+
```

**Important Note:** For MySQL solutions, to escape reserved words used as column names, you can use an apostrophe before and after the keyword. For example **`Rank`**.

```sql
SELECT Score AS score, 
Dense_rank() over (ORDER BY score DESC) AS `Rank`
FROM Scores
```



**180.**

Table: `Logs`

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| num         | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key for this table.
```

 

Write an SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example:

 

```
Logs table:
+----+-----+
| Id | Num |
+----+-----+
| 1  | 1   |
| 2  | 1   |
| 3  | 1   |
| 4  | 2   |
| 5  | 1   |
| 6  | 2   |
| 7  | 2   |
+----+-----+

Result table:
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+
1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.
```

**WRONG**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT l1.Num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM Logs AS l1, Logs AS l2, Logs AS l3
WHERE l1.Num = l2.Num = l3.Num AND
l1.id +1 = l2.id AND l2.id + 1 = l3.id;
```

**CORRECT**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT l1.Num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM Logs AS l1, Logs AS l2, Logs AS l3
WHERE l1.Num = l2.Num  AND l2.Num = l3.Num AND
l1.id +1 = l2.id AND l2.id + 1 = l3.id;
```

Write a SQL query to find all duplicate emails in a table named `Person`.

```
+----+---------+
| Id | Email   |
+----+---------+
| 1  | a@b.com |
| 2  | c@d.com |
| 3  | a@b.com |
+----+---------+
```

For example, your query should return the following for the above table:

```
+---------+
| Email   |
+---------+
| a@b.com |
+---------+
```

**Note**: All emails are in lowercase.

**MY ANSWER**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT A.Email
FROM Person AS A
WHERE Email IN (SELECT DISTINCT B.Email
               FROM Person AS B
               WHERE A.Id <> B.Id);
```

**APPROACH I**

```sql
select Email from
(
  select Email, count(Email) as num
  from Person
  group by Email
) as statistic
where num > 1
;
```

**APPROACH II**

```sql
select Email
from Person
group by Email
having count(Email) > 1;
```



**183.**

Suppose that a website contains two tables, the `Customers` table and the `Orders`table. Write a SQL query to find all customers who never order anything.

Table: `Customers`.

```
+----+-------+
| Id | Name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Joe   |
| 2  | Henry |
| 3  | Sam   |
| 4  | Max   |
+----+-------+
```

Table: `Orders`.

```
+----+------------+
| Id | CustomerId |
+----+------------+
| 1  | 3          |
| 2  | 1          |
+----+------------+
```

Using the above tables as example, return the following:

```
+-----------+
| Customers |
+-----------+
| Henry     |
| Max       |
+-----------+
```



**MY ANSWER**

```sql
SELECT C.Name AS Customers
FROM Customers AS C LEFT JOIN Orders AS O
ON C.Id = O.CustomerId
WHERE O.ID IS NULL;
```

**OTHER ANSWER**

```sql
select customers.name as 'Customers'
from customers
where customers.id not in
(
    select customerid from orders
);
```



**184.**

The `Employee` table holds all employees. Every employee has an Id, a salary, and there is also a column for the department Id.

```
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| Id | Name  | Salary | DepartmentId |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 1            |
| 2  | Jim   | 90000  | 1            |
| 3  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
| 4  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
| 5  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
```

The `Department` table holds all departments of the company.

```
+----+----------+
| Id | Name     |
+----+----------+
| 1  | IT       |
| 2  | Sales    |
+----+----------+
```

Write a SQL query to find employees who have the highest salary in each of the departments. For the above tables, your SQL query should return the following rows (order of rows does not matter).

```
+------------+----------+--------+
| Department | Employee | Salary |
+------------+----------+--------+
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
| IT         | Jim      | 90000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
+------------+----------+--------+
```

**Explanation:**

Max and Jim both have the highest salary in the IT department and Henry has the highest salary in the Sales department.

**MY ANSWER**

```sql
SELECT D.Name AS Department, E.Name AS Employee, E.Salary
FROM Employee AS E INNER JOIN Department AS D
ON (E.DepartmentId = D.Id AND E.Salary = (SELECT MAX(Salary)
                                       FROM Employee
                                       WHERE DepartmentId = D.Id));
                                       
```

INNER JOIN이 핵심

거기에 ON 조건을 괄호를 사용하여 AND 처리 

**OTHER ANSWER**

#### Approach: Using `JOIN` and `IN` clause [Accepted]

**Algorithm**

Since the **Employee** table contains the *Salary* and *DepartmentId* information, we can query the highest salary in a department.

```sql
SELECT
    DepartmentId, MAX(Salary)
FROM
    Employee
GROUP BY DepartmentId;
```

> Note: There might be multiple employees having the same highest salary, so it is safe not to include the employee name information in this query.

```
| DepartmentId | MAX(Salary) |
|--------------|-------------|
| 1            | 90000       |
| 2            | 80000       |
```

Then, we can join table **Employee** and **Department**, and query the (DepartmentId, Salary) are in the temp table using `IN` statement as below.

**MySQL**

```sql
SELECT
    Department.name AS 'Department',
    Employee.name AS 'Employee',
    Salary
FROM
    Employee
        JOIN
    Department ON Employee.DepartmentId = Department.Id
WHERE
    (Employee.DepartmentId , Salary) IN
    (   SELECT
            DepartmentId, MAX(Salary)
        FROM
            Employee
        GROUP BY DepartmentId
    )
;
```

Table: `Weather`

```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| recordDate    | date    |
| temperature   | int     |
+---------------+---------+
id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the temperature in a certain day.
```

 

Write an SQL query to find all dates' `id` with higher temperature compared to its previous dates (yesterday).

Return the result table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example:

```
Weather
+----+------------+-------------+
| id | recordDate | Temperature |
+----+------------+-------------+
| 1  | 2015-01-01 | 10          |
| 2  | 2015-01-02 | 25          |
| 3  | 2015-01-03 | 20          |
| 4  | 2015-01-04 | 30          |
+----+------------+-------------+

Result table:
+----+
| id |
+----+
| 2  |
| 4  |
+----+
In 2015-01-02, temperature was higher than the previous day (10 -> 25).
In 2015-01-04, temperature was higher than the previous day (20 -> 30).
```

MY ANSWER

```sql
SELECT W1.id
FROM Weather AS W1
WHERE W1.Temperature > (SELECT W2.Temperature
                       FROM Weather AS W2
                       WHERE DATEDIFF(W1.recordDate, W2.recordDate) = 1);
```

DATEDIFF가 핵심!
